This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The issue arises when styles are not applied correctly, even though the classes seem to be correctly defined and imported.  This often happens with components that are dynamically rendered or have complex conditional rendering logic. For instance, a button that conditionally changes its color might not reflect the style changes.
